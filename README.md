# Getting Started

## Install `pip`
Your installation might already have `pip` installed. Open a terminal and try
`$ pip`. It's probably also a good idea to upgrade `pip` via `$ pip install -U pip`. Otherwise:

* pip can be installed via the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
* if you have `homebrew` installed you should be able to `$ brew install pip` (if your python installation is not
done through `homebrew`, additional setup might be required here).

*Also Note*: if your python installation is done through `homebrew`, you probably will need to specify that
pip commands be done via `$ pip2 install <X>`, since this project uses/assumes python 2.7.

## Install `Networkx`

`$ pip install networkx[all]` installs with all dependencies.

## Install `matplotlib` (for visualization)

`$ pip install matplotlib`

# Todo
* Add a test script to verify installation for users
* TBA changes for new user friendliness.
