# Introduction and Background

## Outline
This report details how some well known concepts in graph theory can be applied to solve problems in communications, specifically zero-error communication.
## Background

### Graphs
Graphs are entities made up by vertices/nodes (which can represent many different classes of information) and edges between those vertices. The problems addressed in this report deal only with *undirected* graphs, that is, graphs whose edges do not contain any information about direction between two vertices.

#### Strong Product
The strong product of two graphs, G and H is defined as follows:

* Vertices given by the Cartesian product of G and H's vertices
* Two vertices (u, u'), (v, v') have an edge between them if and only if at least one of the following is true:
  * u is adjacent to v and u' = v'
  * u=v and u' is adjacent to v'
  * u is adjacent to v and u' is adjacent to v'

### Coloring
The graph coloring problem looks to find a minimal set of colors that can be assigned to the vertices of a graph, such that no two vertices connected by an edge share a color. Because finding an *optimal* (i.e. minimal size) set of colors requires consideration of all subsets of the vertices of a graph, all known methods of finding such colorings are of *exponential* time complexity with respect to the input. In other words, it takes an impractical amount of time to find an optimal coloring of a graph for all but the smallest input sizes.

### Independent Sets
An independent set of vertices of a graph is a set such that no two vertices in the set are connected by any edge. A *maximum* independent set for a graph is the (or one of the) independent sets of greatest size. For the same reason as the graph coloring problem, solving the maximum independent set problem is also extremely time consuming for large graphs.

# Algorithm Description

## Coloring
The basis of the coloring algorithm used in this report is as follows:

For each vertex, check if it can safely (without breaking correctness) be assigned a color. If so, recursively attempt to color all remaining vertices. If this is not possible, unassign the assigned color. If this subroutine fails for all vertices, the graph is not colorable with the specified number of colors.

This routine is performed for all colorings 1 through k (some upper bound) until either the first, smallest correct coloring is found, or no coloring is found and therefore the graph is not k-colorable.

## Maximum Independent Set
The basis of the maximum independent set algorithm used in this report is as follows:

* If the size of G is 0, return 0
* If the graph has any vertex V with degree 0:
  * return 1 + MIS(G - v)
* If G has any vertex V with degree 1 connected to W:
  * return max(1 + MIS(G with V's neighborhood removed), 1 + MIS(G with W's neighborhood removed))
* If G has any vertex with degree > 2:
  * return max(1 + MIS(G with V's neighborhood removed), MIS(G without V's neighborhood removed))
* else (all vertices U,V,W have degree 2):
  * return max(1 + MIS(G with U's neighborhood removed), 1 + MIS(G with V's neighborhood removed), 1 + MIS(G with W's neighborhood removed ))

# Problem Setup

Consider an nxnxn (specific examples were generated using 3x3x3) matrix S where a given x index is a value of X 0 to (n-1) containing an nxn matrix with rows given by Y values 0 to (n-1) and columns given by Y<sub>r</sub> values 0 to (n-1). First, find the confusability graph G<sub>X|Y,Y<sub>r</sub></sub>. This graph is defined as follows:
* vertices given by X
* edge between two vertices (x, x') if there exists some (y, y<sub>r</sub>) pair such that \
(S[x][y][y<sub>r</sub>] )*(S[x][y][y<sub>r</sub>]) > 0

Next, find the 2-fold strong product of that graph as defined previously. Then, generate the list of graphs G<sub>R|K</sub>, whose vertices are the y<sub>r</sub> values that are reachable via the x values in K, which is a maximum independent set of G<sub>X|Y,Y<sub>r</sub></sub>. An edge exists between two vertices (y<sub>r</sub>, y'<sub>r</sub>) reachable in S if all of the following are true for some values y, x, x', and a given MIS, K:
* x and x' are in K
* x != x'
* y, x, and x' are reachable in S
* S[x][y][y<sub>r</sub>] > 0
* S[x][y][y'<sub>r</sub>] > 0


Next, generate the list of G<sup>2</sup> <sub>R|K</sub> graphs with the 2-fold confusability graph G<sup>2</sup><sub>X|Y,Y<sub>r</sub></sub> in a similar manner, where edges exist between two reachable vertices ((y<sub>r, i</sub>, y<sub>r, j</sub>),(y'<sub>r, i</sub>, y'<sub>r, j</sub>)) if the following are true for some pairs (x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>j</sub>), (x'<sub>i</sub>, x'<sub>j</sub>), (y<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>):

 * y<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>j</sub> are reachable in S
 * (x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>j</sub>), (x'<sub>i</sub>, x'<sub>j</sub>) are in K<sup>2</sup>
 * (y<sub>r, i</sub>, y<sub>r, j</sub>) != (y'<sub>r, i</sub>, y'<sub>r, j</sub>)
 * (x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>j</sub>) != (x'<sub>i</sub>, x'<sub>j</sub>)
 * S[x<sub>i</sub>][y<sub>i</sub>][y<sub>r, i</sub>] > 0
 * S[x<sub>j</sub>][y<sub>j</sub>][y<sub>r, j</sub>] > 0
 * S[x'<sub>i</sub>][y'<sub>i</sub>][y'<sub>r, i</sub>] > 0
 * S[x'<sub>j</sub>][y'<sub>j</sub>][y'<sub>r, j</sub>] > 0

Then, minimally color both the lists of one-fold and two-fold graphs obtained above. Let r be the smallest chromatic number of all the one-fold graphs. For the two-fold graphs, if the square-root of the chromatic number of the graph is smaller than r, a satisfactory example has been found. These examples are formatted and displayed via `matplotlib` (and saved).
